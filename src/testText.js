    essay: "Defining equity to be equal access to opportunity or provided and desired resource, the floorplan of the Kendeda Building is designed in an attempt to maintain aural equity throughout the building and provide ample study and social space. Features of the classrooms and the lecture hall dissipate the sound from the main floor and provide different soundscapes that appeal to many different patrons. The first floor features a large open space which will act as the primary social hub. Most looking to talk with friends over coffee or just hang out and pass some time will flock here making it the main contributor to sound in the building. Other spaces are scattered throughout that are to be utilized as quiet areas. As Anthony Kimpton says in his excerpt, accessibility is important when considering public space and the equity surrounding it. The features of these quiet areas increase the accessibility to quiet space balancing out the two environments of the building and providing equity. If the classrooms were on the first floor with the open space, the sound from this area would drone into the classrooms eliminating the focused environment. Putting the classrooms on the second floor and including sound absorbing designs in the wood floor provides a better and quieter environment more suited to learning rather than socializing. Similar thought went into the lecture halls. Being on the first floor, the droning sound is also a problem. To overcome this, absorbent paneling was included to dissipate unwanted sound and project lecturers’ voices. The steps taken to provide equal access to socialization as well as study in the Kendeda Building’s aural architecture ensures equity for its patrons."
